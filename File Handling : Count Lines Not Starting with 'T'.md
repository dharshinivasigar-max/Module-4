# File Handling in Python: Count Lines Not Starting with 'T'

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file `story.txt` that do **not** start with the alphabet `'T'`.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Open the file `story.txt` in **read mode**.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to zero.
3. Iterate through each line of the file:
   - Check if the first character of the line is **not** `'T'`.
   - If the line does not start with `'T'`, increment the `count` by 1.
4. After processing all lines, print the `count` value, which represents the number of lines that do not start with `'T'`.

## 🧾 Program
```
def count_lines():
 
    file = open("story.txt", "r")

    count = 0
    
    for line in file:

        if not line.strip().startswith('T'):

            count += 1

    print("Total lines not starting with 'T':", count)

    file.close()

count_lines()

```
## Output
Total lines not starting with 'T': 2


## Result
The program successfully opens the specified text file, iterates through its content line-by-line, and utilizes a conditional statement to identify and count lines that do not begin with the character 'T'. The final count is then displayed to the user.
